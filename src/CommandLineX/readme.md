# CommandLine Extensions
[System.CommandLine](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api) is a really handy .Net library for parsing command line arguments passed to an application. Unfortunately a couple of useful features available in its beta stage were removed from the library's release candidates. CommandLineX brings back some of them: **hosting extensions** and **arguments model binding** including DI.
